## Coding Challenge


### First Task

Create queries using this subgraph: https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/ianlapham/uniswap-v3-alt


### Query Prompts

- Given an asset ID:  
  - What pools exist that include it?
  - What is the total volume of that asset swapped in a given time range?
- BONUS! Given a block number:
  - What swaps occurred during that specific block?
  - List all assets swapped during that specific block


### Second Task

Based on the Uniswap v3 subgraph schema (https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-subgraph/blob/main/schema.graphql), add the field "totalUniqueUsers" to the Factory entity. You can test and deploy the updated subgraph using The Graph Studio (https://thegraph.com/studio/). You can send the final code to us either as a zip file or point us to your Github repo. Note that you don't have to fully sync your subgraph as long as you are certain it's correct. It may take a while to sync the entire subgraph.
